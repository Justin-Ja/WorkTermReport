                For my third co-op work term, I started working at <a href="https://mantech-inc.com/" target="_blank">MANTECH</a>.
                MANTECH is a company that manufactures innovative water/soil quality analysis systems in the form of different chemistry
                hardwares (such as their PeCOD machine, or robots for automated titration and analysis) and software packages that interfaces with the 
                hardwares. The mission of MANTECH is to "generate the highest quality results, in the shortest amount of time, with green methods, using simple and smart analyzers."
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Job Description / Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
                The job for this co-op revolves around the development of a brand new software package for the company. Currently, their main package, MANTECH PRO
                is quite old, from the user interface to the way the code was written. The company wants to completely overhaul this software into a new package called MANTECH NEXTGEN,
                which would update every aspect of the software, from the way users interact with it, to how the code is designed to "future-proof" it in case of future updates/bug fixes etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                My responsibilities for this term was to work on several different hardware screens. This task was to create different screens in C#'s WPFs that would interface with 
                some of the hardware that we provide. I got to create the screens for conductivity meters, spectrophotometers and metering pumps. 
                This work covered front-end, back-end, database changes and additions. It also included moving the related hardware DLLs into sub-repositories in the project for better maintenance/logging of changes.
                The main idea of the screens was to be able to easily add a new hardware 'profile' to the program and be able to update and manually calibrate the hardware to ensure its set up correctly.
                In the future, these profiles will be used in other parts of the program, (such as a script action section to automate running some of these machines) so development of these screens had to keep that in mind.

            </div> 
            <p class="caption">Above is when I got to test out the conductivity meters I worked on! (Had to censor the screen that shows the actual program)</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>For this third work term I had three goals:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Become more familiar with OOP programming and desgin principles that are related to building applications in an object oriented format</li>
                <li>Take on more development challenges and larger projects that need to be completed in the codebase.</li>
                <li>Have better time management with bigger projects given to me, and to be able to develop over time in a more consistent manner</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I believe I achieved the first two goals, but am still  still working on that third goal. <br><br>
                
                Firstly, I believe I have become more familiar with OOP and related design principles. This is more thoroughly explained in the accomplishments section, but I've become more skilled with C#,
                learning how to best separate classes and following SOLID principles and learned about dependency injections. <br><br>
                Secondly, this workterm only consisted of large features spanning multiple areas of the codebase
                so it was easy to work on this goal. These hardware screens consisted of coding on the whole stack, to lengthy testing and longer PR reviews with a lot of feedback. <br><br>
                Finally, I still think I am working on this third goal. The main issue is that  I find myself being able to stay on track for a week or two at a time, 
                but there are still weeks in between where I do not end up hitting that goal that I set out to reach at the start of the week. I will keep working on this goal over the 4th term 
                and see if I can reach a point where I can say I've hit this goal for sure.
            </p>

            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>
                I had a couple of accomplishments with this work term: <br><br>
                
                The first accomplishment this work term  was learning to work with C# and the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern.  
                This design pattern was important for maintaining separation of concerns and ensuring that the UI elements remained loosely connected with the back-end logic. 
                I learned how to appropriately arrange ViewModels to control data binding and separation of responsibilities for classes, which improved the scalability and maintainability of the code. 

                I also had hands-on experience with dependency injection which allowed for more modularity of classes and components across the project. 
                This was mainly accomplished through constructor injections, and by creating the objects towards the root of the project, but halfway through the co-op, this got overhauled with a new tool called Autofac. 
                This allowed developers to easily register interfaces for Autofac to construct at runtime for dependency injections to work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another accomplishment was having to work around an outdated DLL library when I was working with a hardware device called a metering pump. The issue was this DLL was created to run on 32-bit systems, and 
                not with .net-8.0 projects. To add on top of this, MANTECH didn't develop this DLL unlike the majority of the other libraries, this was outsourced to a company whos postponed the update.
                I had the job to not only still develop the metering pump hardware screen, but also determine a way to test it. Luckily, Visual Studio has a way to specify target CPU platform,
                so I could run the program at least. The other challenge ended up being a guess-and-check of where the DLL needed to be in the project (as it consisted of multiple files and was particularly finicky
                with its setup files). In the end, I got the metering pump screen completed, tested, approved and merged into the main project.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The start of this 8-month co-op has gone great so far. Its been nice to work a development job on a new tech stack that I wasn't familiar with and learning more 
                software design choices. I have enjoyed learning C#, and with its abilitiy to easily develop a desktop application, I'm been thinking of side projects that I could start that
                would work well in an application format. It's also been really interesting to get to work with the hardware itself to test my code, having a physical component to testing is fun compared to 
                standard bug/QA testing of a purely software application.
