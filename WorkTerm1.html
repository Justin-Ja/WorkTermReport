            </div>
            <p>For my first co-op work term, I was hired to work at a start-up, ed-tech company called <a href="https://www.kritik.io/" target="_blank">Kritik</a>, founded in 2019. 
                Kritik is a peer-assessment platform that allows instructors to create or upload activities for their courses and gives 
                students the opportunity to evaluate each otherâ€™s creations with a rubric provided by the instructor through the activity, 
                and then give feedback to whoever evaluated their own creation.
            </p>
            <p>Kritik was created in 2019 by two co-founders Mohsen Shahini and Carine Marette in order to help students develop critical thinking skills through higher order think skills
                and help instructors to increase engagment levels, reducing grading burden and to help prepare students more effeciently for tests.
            </p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>For this first  work term I had three goals:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Learn to work with others in terms of bigger projects/features that are being developed</li>
                <li>Work and gain more experience with different developer tools used within a work environment.</li>
                <li>Embrace the work environment and engage with a constant work flow</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I believe I hit all three goals that I had set out for myself. First of all, My contributions to the team's work have resulted in positive and constructive feedback from multiple developers.
                I have worked with other developers to push new features to production for users to enjoy (more on that in the next seciton). Secondly, I have become much more familiar with several different developer tools.
                These range from coding related tools and languanges such as Vitest, Cypress e2e tests, Typescript, Postgresql to other tools used to help run the application such as AWS deployment and bastion servers and datadog to view error logs for debugging.
                Finally, I have become comfortable with the work environment and flow, with a steady amount of tickets completed each sprint, consistenly completing more than the number I had set out in my goals.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Job Description, Responsibilities and Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>On the average week, I was responsible for working on the priority tickets for that sprint, and then any other tickets if the main ones were completed.
                Starting in July, I also joined the on-call rotation. While on-call I was responsible for responding to the CS team when they either reported a bug from the user or a request, by investigating the issue and respond accordingly. 
                I also was responsible for deploying hotfixes in case of serious bugs and releasing a new version of the application at the end of my rotation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my first workterm, I was able to contribute to a few epics and work on new features as well. 
                Some of the notable epics I worked on include helping migrate databases, from using MongoDB to Postgresql with Prisma as an ORM, 
                allowing instructors to connect one course to multiple Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Canvas and Moodle
                and role management, which allows users to be an Instructor, TA or a student in different courses without having to create multiple accounts. 
                Another epic I worked on with one other developer was accessibility in the app. The accessibility features in the app needed to be updated in order to help secure enterprise deals from big universities. 
                After we finished implementation, we ran a scan of the product and 91% of elements in the application had no detected violations. 
                For reference, running the scan on Canvas, Youtube and Facebook returned a score of 86%, 70% and 93% respectively.
            </p>

            </div> 
            <p>
                For features, I created a new scoring type for rubric criteria called <a href="https://help.kritik.io/en/articles/8308653-mode-scoring" target="_blank">mode scoring</a>. Originally, students were scored on a weighted average scale, 
                but this new feature allows instructors to select certain criteria to use the mode to determine a score. 
                This feature was highly requested by a VIP professor using Kritik, and the CS team was happy to announce the feature once it got rolled out.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, I am happy with the co-op position I had for the summer. 
                I was able to work and learn in a work environment, learn more about several different developer tools and got to work with an amazing team that had my back and was willing to support me.
                I believe that the work I did at this co-op placement helped enhance my knowledge of Computer Science I have so far learned from academic experience.
