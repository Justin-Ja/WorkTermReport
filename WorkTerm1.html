    <h1>Work Term Report #1</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>For my first co-op work term, I was hired at a company called Kritik</p>

            <h2>About the employer</h2>
            <p>For my first co-op work term, I was hired to work at a start-up, ed-tech company called Kritik, founded in 2019. 
                Kritik is a peer-assessment platform that allows instructors to create or upload activities for their courses and gives 
                students the opportunity to evaluate each otherâ€™s creations with a rubric provided by the instructor through the activity, 
                and then give feedback to whoever evaluated their own creation.
            </p>
            <p>Kritik was created in 2019 by two co-founders X and Y</p>

            <h2>Job Description and Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>On the average week, I was responsible for working on the priority tickets for that sprint, and then any other tickets if the main ones were completed. //MORE Starting in July, I also joined the on-call rotation. While on-call I was responsible for responding to the CS team when they either reported a bug from the user or a request, by investigating the issue and respond accordingly. 
                I also was responsible for deploying hotfixes in case of serious bugs and releasing a new version of the application at the end of my rotation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my first workterm, I was able to contribute to a few epics and work on new features as well. 
                Some of the notable epics I worked on include helping migrate databases, from using MongoDB to Postgresql with Prisma as an ORM, 
                allowing instructors to connect one course to multiple Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Canvas and Moodle
                and role management, which allows users to be an Instructor, TA or a student in different courses without having to create multiple accounts. 
                Another epic I worked on with one other developer was accessibility in the app. The accessibility features in the app needed to be updated in order to help secure enterprise deals from big universities. 
                After we finished implementation, we ran a scan of the product and 91% of elements in the application had no detected violations. 
                For reference, running the scan on Canvas, Youtube and Facebook returned a score of 86%, 70% and 93% respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                For features, I created a new scoring type for rubric criteria called mode scoring. Originally, students were scored on a weighted average scale, 
                but this new feature allows instructors to select certain criteria to use the mode to determine a score. 
                This feature was highly requested by a VIP professor using Kritik, and the CS team was happy to announce the feature once it got rolled out.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, I am happy with the co-op position I had for the summer. 
                I was able to work and learn in a work environment, learn more about several different developer tools and got to work with an amazing team that had my back and was willing to support me.
